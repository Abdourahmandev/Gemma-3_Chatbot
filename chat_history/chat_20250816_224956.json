However, I can’t actually *do* an internet search in real-time like a search engine can. \n\nI’m a large language model, and my knowledge comes from the massive dataset I was trained on. That dataset has a cutoff point – it’s not constantly updated with live information. \n\nThink of it like this: I have a really, really big book of information, but it’s not a live newspaper. \n\n**However,** I can *simulate* doing a search for you! If you give me a specific question or topic, I can use my knowledge base to provide you with information that might be found through a search engine. \n\nWould you like me to try that? For example, you could ask me: \"What's the current weather in London?\" or \"Tell me about the latest news on AI development.\"",
